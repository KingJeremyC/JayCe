		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Left behind a life of contract labour to pursue my dream of creating worlds and inspiring change, which further coalesced into a slightly less shiny dream, "The Starving Artist"! Starting in 2016, moved to Toronto to attend TFS' game dev course where I excelled with networking, leadership, mentorship, and worked towards personal growth.
		Provided artistic/technical assistance to multiple capstone projects during my time at TFS, at the same time gathering/leading teams for multiple game-jams such as ToJam and Global Game Jam. Then, shortly after graduation, the whole world stopped spinning during the pandemic. Since then i've honed my skills in art & animation, focusing on 
		VFX and node-based shader creation, and also often writing GDD's and story/mechanic ideas for future projects, while also keeping my 3d modeling/animation skills sharp (it's pretty much all I do).</p>
		<p>Initially I was trained with 3ds Max, Photoshop, Z-Brush, Marvelous Designer, Substance Painter/Designer, Unity and Unreal. After graduation I had to teach myself new(free) apps, currently proficient with Blender, GIMP, Unity and for the sake of video editing, DaVinci Resolve.</p>

				<h3>Trials of the Fallen - TFS Term 6 Capstone Project 2018 |Team Name: Dollar Coffee Games |Art Lead, game design, level design, VFX, shaders, general 3d art</h3>
				<p>Capstone project of my team in TFS, we were the first capstone team to attempt making an AR game which left us with minimal mentorship regarding project setup and optimization, as well as one of the smallest teams to create a playable demo with a trailer for people to test and view during the presentation of the project. Initially I was the 
				tech artist focusing on particle effects and helping the programmers communicate with the artists, eventually I took a role as art lead, responsible for the overall art direction. At the end of the project, me and the other 3d artist on the team had a few days of crunch time, modeling/texturing/animating non-stop, as much of it was left undone 
				or "lost".</p>

				<h3>Gearsenscion - TFS Term 6 Capstone Project 2017 | Team Name: SwiftyLoop Studio |VFX, shaders, general 3d support</h3>
				<p>Capstone from the team one term ahead of me, provided help with particles and animated UI elements as well as teaching node logic to their other artists. I was mainly a support/consultant role in this project as they had a really good team mentality and had a lot of their design fleshed out by the time I joined. Spent roughly 4 months on this
				project close to the end of it all. My term was the next capstone so it was good experience to see what we could expect going into the final term, switching from learning full-time to developing.</p>

			<div class="project-three">
				<h3>Temple of the Aztecs - Extra Life Game Jam 2016 |Creative lead, game design, level design, art design, VFX, shaders, general 3d art</h3>
				<p>The first game/game jam in my career, unfortunately the project is lost to the sands of time, we didn't know we actually made a good game! TFS used it on their website to promote the course for a few years but it's buried there in the bloat too. A short but sweet puzzle based game where the player uses an ancient artifact to navigate a temple, 
				completing puzzles to escape or be sealed inside forever. I was in charge of art design and overall game direction, as the team was small we all had a hand in level design, each member designed their own room layout and puzzle. I started this project as a way for my class to mesh together and get used to working long hours, and it worked 
				out well. As there's no visual references, the artifact was a Gold triangle with a hole in the middle, and RGB colored crystal tips; the temple was a mossy stone collection of rooms with multiple levels, not much UI other than the artifact glowing when close to an interactive, and some on-screen text when a puzzle took 10+ minutes to finish. </p>
